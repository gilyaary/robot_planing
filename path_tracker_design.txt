The idea is to plan a path along a perceived line and follow it.
1. Find a point closest to the current location of the robot
2. Calculate the robot's pose w.r.t the point (look at angle)
3. From that point start going with increasing angles to locate distances to other points
4. Plan a smooth path that will pass with a certain distance to the other points
Identify where the robot is w.r.t the planned path
5. Calculate the angular and linear velocities needed to make a single correction (gradient)
that will move the robot closer to the path. If the linear velocity is constant then that
we need only calculate the angular velocity needed. The farter we are from the desired angle
the faster we should rotate.
6. A time unit passes by, we check where we are w.r.t the path and what correction we should make
If our path needs to be recalculated and if so we recalculate. This can be because the current path 
is almost complete (we are close to the path's end)
7. Use splines to connect the perceived points as a smooth path.
8. 

Breaking apart the challenge:
We follow a devide and concure approach:
1. Task 1: Plan a path from the observations. (1-4 above)
2. Task 2: Given a path calculate the gradient needed to minimize the error between the 
robot position and the path. This is needed because the angular speed is a change is 
distance in time so we want the gradient. Assume constant speed.
